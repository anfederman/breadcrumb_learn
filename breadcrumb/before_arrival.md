# If You Don't Have Your Robot Yet

Breadcrumb is optimized to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4.
If you have one (especially if you have Pi Camera for it), there are numerous things you can do easily*, even if you don't have one of out Magni Robots.  It would be possible to run our software on other platforms, but it would take a lot of effort to edit the various parameters.

* You can install our virtual machine on your workstation. It can be [downloaded](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/) from the Ubiquity Robotics site. It has ROS already installed.

--or, if you have a machine running Ubuntu 16.04 --
* You can set up ROS on your workstation.
The ROS site gives full instructions. By the time yu read this, we may have already migrated to a Noetic version of the softwate.

* You can connect the Pi to your workstation directly.
See the [instructions](https://ubiquityrobotics.github.io/learn/connecting).

* You can generate and print fiducials. You can then recognize fiducials using the camera.
See the [instructions](how_to_generate_markers.md).

* You can follow the Pi using Rviz and rqt_image_view on your workstation.
See the [instructions](rviz) in the Doing More section.

* We are also offering a Gazebo simulation you can run on your Workstation and a couple of demos you can refere to, to get a sense how the Breadcrumb is intended to be running. For more infomations go [here](gazebo)
